#RAD Tools


This repository contains several tools built by CoBiGÂ² members to help us dead with RAD and GBS data.
The existing tools are mentioned below.

##VCF2phy

This is a converter from VCF to phylip format. ~~It is currently does not create the phylip header, you have to do it yourself.~~ Headers are created fine too.

##RAD parser

This is a demultiplexer for RAD and GBS data. It is still incomplete, because it is still lacking a way to remove the barcodes and the enzyme cut sites. Should be done pretty soon.
